## Design Goals
- Identify the brand image - energized & cool
- Identify the objectives - engagement & functionality
- Identify the main focus - product & add to cart
- Solve above from UX/UI point of view, develop a user friendly, intuitive Design

## Methods
- Resposive design: UI/UX consistancy on mobile, tablet and desktop
- Full screen layout on desktop. Emphasis on product to elevate customer emotion
- Simplify interactions, more intuitive UI
- Benificial product marketing information centralized right under CTA
- Site cleanup, re-organize information: remove duplications, reduce color usage, etc.

## Not included, TODO
- Global nav
  - Simplified header: merge Sport and Brand into base categories; less obvious yet still clear enough Search
  - Header shall respond more to scrolling
- Carousel touch control for mobile
  - touch swipe for navigation
  - touch zooming
- Sizing Chart
  - centralize all sizing related info and interactions
