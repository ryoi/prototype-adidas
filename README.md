# PDP Prototype for Adidas

See DEMO page [here](https://ryoi.github.io/prototype-adidas/).

## Notes
- Only supports latest Chrome and Safari
- Supports responsive layout, which can be viewed on mobile, tablet and desktop
- Some UI modules are not fully functional. (eg. topmenu dropdowns, footer, carousel touch event support, sizing chart, etc.)

## Design Goals
- Identify the brand image - energized & cool
- Identify the objectives - engagement & functionality
- Identify the main focus - product & add to cart
- Solve above from UX/UI point of view, develop a user friendly, intuitive Design

## Methods
- Resposive design: UI/UX consistancy on mobile, tablet and desktop
- Full screen layout on desktop. Bigger product image to elevate customer emotion
- Less but more intuitive interactions
- Benificial product marketing information centralized under CTA
- Reorganize site information: remove duplications, reduce color usage

## Not included, TODO
- Global nav
  - Simplified header: merge Sport and Brand into base categories; less obvious yet still clear enough Search
  - Header shall respond more to scrolling
- Carousel touch control for mobile
  - touch swipe for navigation
  - touch zooming
- Sizing Chart
  - centralize all sizing related info into modal or popup (might contain interaction within)
